# Verify-E-NEWS
 PROBLEM STATEMENT


 Misinformation and fake news have proliferated in the digital information age, thanks to the
 quick spread of news via the internet and social media platforms. This phenomenon has the
 ability to sway public opinion, distort social discourse, and even have an impact on democratic
 processes. As a result, technologies that assist users in distinguishing between reliable news and
 misinformation are critical.
 
 THE SOLUTION
 
 To develop a JavaFX application that assists users in verifying the authenticity of news articles.
 The application will provide an interface where users can input news text or links, which will
 then be analyzed by verified users/admins to determine the likelihood of the news being fake or
 real. The goal is to create an accessible, user-friendly tool that leverages object oriented design
 techniques to evaluate news content.
 
 FUNCTIONALITY AND TOPICS OF COVERED
 
 The topic which would be covered are
 Class Definition, Inheritance, Abstract classes, Queues and Maps.
 Class Definition- We would be creating multiple classes for the project. Different classes would
 be created for the users and the news articles.
 Inheritance- There would be multiple types of users in this project, the normal end users and the
 verified user who would be responsible for verifying the articles. We would create a superclass
 Users from which the subclasses (Enduser and verified user) would be extended.
 Abstract classes- Multiple abstract classes will be present to provide common functionalities and
 signatures for the users and the news articles.
 Queue- The queue data structure would be utilized to store the news articles.
 
 Functionalities- 
 
 Add User- Addnewusers to the system
 Add Articles- Add new articles which will be verified
 Verify Articles- Verify the authenticity of the articles
 List Articles- List all the articles for the users to read
 Add Verified User- Add verified users who will be responsible for checking the authenticity of
 the articles.
